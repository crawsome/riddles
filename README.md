# Riddles
I love riddles. I couldn't find a good enough collection across the internet, so I made one in my [Python RPG](github.com/crawsome/pyRPG_mini). Now, I'm offering this for free in hopes of it getting bigger and better. 

## Disclaimer:
The dataset isn't perfect and needs pruning, and needs more riddles. Help me by submitting a pull request, or an issue!

### What are Riddles? They're not Jokes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddle

#### Riddles are **Enigmas**
Problems in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking
* YES to Logic, to a degree.
* YES Philosophy

#### Riddles are also **Conduras**
Questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer
* YES Puns
* YES Wordplay
* YES Double-meanings and synonyms

### Technicalities:
Technicalities go here. Weird off-case stuff. 
* No integers or symbols, make your answers in words only. One. Two. Three. Plus, Minus. 

### Don't put these in the dataset: 
* One-liners 
* Fun Facts / "Did you know"
* Life-pro-tips
* Boomer humor / cliche / antihumor / cringe / racism / cruel / sexual or alluding to sexual humor
* Riddles cannot be associated with each other or cross-refernce each other to be completed. 
* * *"I'm the answer to #31 and #56 in the pulural sense"*
* No long riddles. [Nate the Snake](https://web.archive.org/web/20200329123356/https://natethesnake.com/) was a fun read, but that's not what this is for, lol. 
* I would argue against esoteric and domain knowledge jokes, they should belong in their own dataset IMHO. 
* * *"Why did the waterfall circult never blow out under load? Because he made preparations to diode!"*

# Policy 
I didn't write these. These are from all around the internet. LMK if you find an unsavory or terrible riddles.
